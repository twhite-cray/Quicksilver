***** Notice ******
The main focus of the package is to demonstrate as-is application functionality
on systems with HPE Cray EX235A “Bard Peak” nodes running the COS operating system.

Quicksilver
===========
A. Description
This is README for building and running the as-is CORAL-2 Quicksilver benchmark.

B. TLDR Instructions
The following steps will build and run the Quicksilver benchmark on
HPE BardPeak systems using AMD Rocm and SLURM.

   build_quicksilver.sh
   sbatch -A <account> -N 1 run_quicksilver.slurm
   sbatch -A <account> -N 8 run_quicksilver.slurm
   sbatch -A <account> -N 2250 run_quicksilver.slurm
   sbatch -A <account> -N 2304 run_quicksilver.slurm
   sbatch -A <account> -N 2340 run_quicksilver.slurm
   sbatch -A <account> -N 2352 run_quicksilver.slurm

C. Building
The Quicksilver source code is provided in the "src/" subdirectory and a
bash script "build_quicksilver.sh" is provided to build the Quicksilver
executable. This should be run as

   ./build_quicksilver.sh | tee output/build.log 2>&1

The quicksilver binary will be created in

   src/qs

Reference compilation output from building on ORNL's Crusher system has
been provided in the reference_output subdirectory.

D. Running
A single SLURM batch script "run_quicksilver.slurm" is provided for running
Quicksilver. The script is generic in that it auto-detects the number of
nodes allocated to the job and scales the workload to run on the allocated
number of nodes. To run:

   sbatch -A <account> -N <number-of-nodes> run_quicksilver.slurm

Run output will be created in the output subdirectory in a uniquely named
subdirectory - the subdirectory name follows the requested benchmark
specifications

   output/job-<N>n-<SLURM_JOBID>

where <N> is the number of nodes.

The standard output from the benchmark run is caputured in the file:

   output/job-<N>n-<SLURM_JOBID>/quicksilver.out

The figure of merit for the benchmark run is reported directly in the
standard output file and can be extracted using:

    grep "Figure Of Merit" output/*/quicksilver.out
    
Reference outputs for runs on up to 2352 nodes for ORNL's Frontier system
have been provided in the reference_output subdirectory.

E. Verification
A self-assessment of a valid run is performed during the run and reported
at the end of the standard output - there should be four lines that start
with "PASS" indicating that the corresponding verification test has passed.
To check for verfication, use the following to make sure there are four
passing tests for each runtime configuration:

   grep PASS output/*/quicksilver.out | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | uniq -c

For example, for "reference_output":

$ grep PASS reference_output/*/quicksilver.out | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | uniq -c
      4 reference_output/job-1n-389630/quicksilver.out:PASS::
      4 reference_output/job-2250n-389644/quicksilver.out:PASS::
      4 reference_output/job-2304n-389643/quicksilver.out:PASS::
      4 reference_output/job-2340n-389642/quicksilver.out:PASS::
      4 reference_output/job-2352n-389633/quicksilver.out:PASS::
      4 reference_output/job-8n-389631/quicksilver.out:PASS::
